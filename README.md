# Welcome to The Hive

![The Hive](public/logo.png)

Getting started with OSS should be trivial by now, but while getting the first easy PR is... well, easy, moving on from there is not.
Picking the right project to contribute can be a daunting task:

- Where do you look for it?
- How can you look for projects using technology you know?
- How can you tell if the project is looking for help?
- Is the project you're looking at actively being maintained or has it been abandoned years ago?
- Are the maintainers paying attention to outside PRs?

And the questions pile up.
If you're a project owner (or a Startup with an OSS project), you might be looking for help. But how can you find those developers? Cold outreach barely works, you get ignored, especially if you're starting out with a project with 0 stars.

The Hive (working title) attempts to be a central place for OSS contributors to meet and easily find OSS projects.
And at the same time, for OSS projects to find active and eager contributors.

If you'd like to be informed about new updates to this project, either star the repo or leave your email in [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwvdUDA15eVZ0B8lf4b4XsXRmTdMwBAXBEqMAwLFo0LvOUPQ/viewform1), I'll make sure to send you updates.

## Testing The Hive locally

If you're interested in testing this project locally, all you have to do is:

1. Add a `.env.local` file on the root of the project
2. Add the following content inside:

```
GITHUB_ID=<your github app id>
GITHUB_SECRET=<your github app secret>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<a string generated by you>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<the url of your supabase project>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your supabase anon key>
```
3. Start the server with `npm run dev`and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributing

This project is still in early development. If you'd still like to contribute, by all means fork the repo and send a PR, but first reach out to me and let's discuss what you're looking to add.
Once the project grows, I'll start adding a more formal process to handle contributions.

## Licensing

TBD, still looking into it, soon to be updated.
